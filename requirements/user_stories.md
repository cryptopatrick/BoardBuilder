We want to use <BoardBuilder to help us build skateboards that have a low carbon footprint>
So that <our company can rightfully market itself as a Green skateboard manufacturer>.

As a <logistics_manager>
I want to <load a json inventory list of skateboard parts with their properties to our database>

I want to <get a report of daily changes to the database inventory>
So that <I can order new parts from our suppliers>

# Stakeholder: Product Manager
As a <product_manager>
I want to <select the parts of the skateboard>
So that <I can receive a specification of the board>.

I want to <assign dependecies to individual parts of the skateboard>
